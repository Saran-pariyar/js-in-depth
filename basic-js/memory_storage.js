/**
 * JS automatically allocates memory when objects are created and free when not used anymore. It is Garbage Collection
 * 
 * DATATYPE
  1. Primitive datatype:  directly stored in stack, where it is accessed from. (string,num, bool, null, undefined, symbol, BigInt). Also called static datatype cause value doesn't change and JS can allocate fixed amount of memory space

  2. Reference datatype are stored in heap and accessed by reference. (Arr, fun, obj). Value isn't fixed, more memory than required is allocated for it. So it cannot be stored in stack.
    See the image to learn what accessing object from reference means.
